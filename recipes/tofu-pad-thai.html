            <li>1 cup cubed extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 thai red chilies, chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut aminos</li>
            <li>1 cup beansprouts, chopped</li>

        <h3>Noodles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 ounce rice noodles</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a small saucepan, add tamarind, coconut aminos, coconut sugar, chili garlic sauce, lime juice, and vegetarian fish sauce (optional) and heat over medium heat until just simmering. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring occasionally, then turn off heat. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Ensure all stir fry ingredients are prepped, including cubed (briefly pressed) tofu, chopped green onions, minced garlic, bean sprouts, and chopped peanuts. If serving with peanut sauce (optional), prepare at this time.</li>
        <li>Add Pad Thai noodles to a large bowl and cover with just boiling water. Stir and cover and cook according to package instructions (usually about 5-6 minutes or until al dente).</li>
        <li>Drain noodles and toss with a little sesame oil to prevent sticking. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large-rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and tofu and saut√© for about 4 minutes, turning occasionally so it browns on all sides. Add red pepper flakes or Thai chilies, garlic, and coconut aminos (be careful, as the coconut aminos can splatter). Toss gently to combine until garlic is just slightly browned. </li>
        <li>Add noodles, Pad Thai sauce, bean sprouts, green onions, and peanuts and cook over medium-high heat, tossing occasionally (tongs are most useful) for about 2-3 minutes or until the sauce has coated everything and the dish is hot.</li>
        <li>To serve, plate with additional garnishes such as lime wedges, bean sprouts, peanut sauce, shredded carrot, cilantro, and sriracha or chili garlic sauce (all optional).</li>
    </ol>
