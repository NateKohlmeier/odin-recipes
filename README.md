this will be used as a self reflection after I have finished.

I finished the project on March 2nd, 2022. I didn't touch the project for about two weeks after starting. I had a bit of knowledge in html beforehand and thought this project wasn't worth taking the time to do, but doing this project, however repetitive it may feel, is better than doing nothing.

That being said, in the end I essentially did the bear minimum for this project. Still glad I did it in the end.
